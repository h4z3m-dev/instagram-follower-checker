# Follower Comparison Tool: Find Who Doesnâ€™t Follow Back

## Description
This script extracts and compares follower and following data from JSON files to identify users who do not follow back. It is useful for analyzing non-mutual connections on social media accounts.

## Features
- Extracts usernames from JSON files.
- Compares the list of following vs. followers.
- Identifies users who do not follow back.
- Outputs the list of non-mutual followers to a text file.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage
1. Place your `following.json` and `followers_1.json` files in the script directory.
2. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```
3. The script will generate two extracted text files:
   - `following after extracting.txt`
   - `followers after extracting.txt`
4. A final output file, `Who Doesnâ€™t Follow Back.txt`, will contain the list of users who donâ€™t follow back.
